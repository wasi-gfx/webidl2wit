# WIP WebIDL to wit conversion.
This code was written in a hacky way, plans to improve it soon.

Side effects of reading this code may include facepalming, mouth drops, and a strong desire to rewrite all of it. Proceed at your own risk.


## Conversions from WebIDL to wit types.
> **_NOTE:_** This does not represent what's currently implemented, this only shows future plans.

If you have any thoughts, please use the [discussion about this table](https://github.com/MendyBerger/webidl-wit/discussions/1) to chime in.
