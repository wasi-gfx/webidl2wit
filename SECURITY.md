# Security Policy

Please refer to the [Bytecode Alliance security
policy](https://bytecodealliance.org/security) for details on how to report
security issues in Wasmtime, our disclosure policy, and how to receive
notifications about security issues.

For classification of what is and what isn't a security issue please see our
[online
documentation](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/security-what-is-considered-a-security-vulnerability.html)
on the subject.
